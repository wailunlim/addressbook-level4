== Setting Up

image::settingup.png[width="200"]

This section sets up your local computer and import all the necessary tools required to run this application.

[WARNING]
Read this section in detail and follow the configurations carefully. Otherwise, the application may not work as expected.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

image::designheader.png[width="320"]

This section shows an overview of the design decisions for this application. It serves to allow you to better understand the various components linking this application together.


[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

._Architecture Diagram_
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

{empty} +

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

._Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `client#1 delete`.

._Component interactions for `client#1 delete ` command (part 1)_ +
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

._Component interactions for `client#1 delete` command (part 2)_ +
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

._Structure of the UI Component_
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `LoginWindow` and a `MainWindow`. The `MainWindow` is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
._Structure of the Logic Component_
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("client#1 delete")` API call.

._Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `client#1 delete` Command_
image::DeleteClientSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

._Structure of the Model Component_
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores the Account data that was used to log in.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

._Structure of the Storage Component_
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Account Storage component

._Structure of the Account Storage Component_
image::AccountStorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AccountStorage.java[`AccountStorage.java`]

The `AccountStorage` component

* can save the Account data in xml format and read it back.
* can populate a default root Account data in xml format if missing
* can update existing Account password stored in the storage

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

image::implementationheader.png[width="400"]

Before you start, you'd need to find out how *_Heart²_*'s features work!
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::undoredoDisplay[]
===== Aspect: What it shows after undo/redo command successfully executes

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Shows the list that was changed due to the undo/redo command.
** Pros: Easy for the user to identify what was changed, whether a client or vendor was modified.
** Cons: It switches the list out of the current filter and the user have to re-type the list command if he wants to filter the list.
* *Alternative 2:* Keeps showing what was shown before the command was executed.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Hard for the user to identify what was changed in the addressbook.
* *Alternative 3:* Show what was changed, before and after.
** Pros: User can easily tell what was changed.
** Cons: Hard to implement, need to have an additional UI components to show what was changed and need additional components to store the list before it was changed.
// end::undoredoDisplay[]
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::login[]
=== Login Feature

Before user can use *_Heart²_*, they must first log in with a registered account.

==== Before logging in
User is presented with a login UI:

._The login screen when user launches the application._
image::UiLoginDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

There are only 3 commands available for user to execute:

* `login` : Login to the system with a username and password
* `help` : Shows the help panel
* `exit` : Quit the application

==== After logging in
The `LoginWindow` would direct to open the `MainWindow` upon successful login, by parsing in the current `stage`.

User can execute any commands available, provided the user-account is given the correct privilege. However, user cannot execute the `login` command again since he is already logged in.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: When to show the Login UI
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Deploy the `LoginWindow` only upon launch.
** Pros: Similar to existing applications, easier for users to use
** Cons: Difficult to implement
* *Alternative 2:* Incorporate `LoginWindow` within `MainWindow`
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Users are able to see the main UI before login

=== Account creation
Account is created for the purpose of logging in and authenticating the user, before the user is allowed to use the application. This protects the confidentiality and data integrity of the application.

[NOTE]
User can only register for an account via an existing account with `SUPER_USER` privilege. It may sound counter-intuitive to require an account before registering a new account. We make this requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.

==== Types of account
There are 2 types of account:

* `SUPER_USER` : A user that is capable of executing all commands available in the application.
* `READ_ONLY_USER` : A user that is capable of executing all commands except registering new account, adding, editing, and deleting entries in the database.

These 2 types of accounts are referred as Role and facilitated by the `Role` enum.

The restrictions of a `READ_ONLY_USER` is enforced by the methods found in `Account` class, specifically:

* `boolean hasWritePrivilege()`
* `boolean hasDeletePrivilege()`
* `boolean hasAccountCreationPrivilege()`

Commands that prevents a `READ_ONLY_USER` from executing is checked with a condition as such:

[source,java]
if (!account.hasWritePrivilege()) {
    throw new LackOfPrivilegeException(COMMAND_WORD);
}

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Should the privilege be tied to Role enum or Account class?
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Account class contains the privileges methods such has `hasWritePrivilege`.
** Pros: This makes sense as the type of privilege is tied to the account.
* *Alternative 2:* Role enum should contains the privileges methods
** Pros: Since Role enum contains all the different roles such as `READ_ONLY_USER` and `SUPER_USER`, it is easy to reference all the different types of roles and the privileges in 1 file. This makes adding more roles and privileges in the future easy.
** Cons: It sounds awkward to have privileges associated with Role rather than with an Account.

===== Aspect: What type of access control to use?
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Role based access control. (RBAC)
** Pros: Most relevant in the context of this application. Allows application owner to set privileges for employees.
** Cons: User does not have a say in access control, even in content created by them.
* *Alternative 2:* Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
** Pros: Less restrictive. Allows individual complete control over content they have created.
** Cons: Not really applicable in our context as we want to restrict employee access to data. Employee's access control based on their individual roles in the company seems more appropriate than employees having access based on the content they create.


=== Account storage
All accounts are stored in a file call `/data/accountlist.xml`. This file is generated on the fly during first launch and populated with a root account. By default, a root account is hardcoded into the application with the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword` with the role `SUPER_USER`.

The diagram below shows what happen when a user launches the application:

._Activity diagram when user launches the application_
image::accountstoragediagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

Only a `SUPER_USER` is allowed to create a new account, either for himself, or on behalf of another person. The diagram below shows what happen when a user attempts to register a new account:

._Activity diagram when user registers an account_
image::accountcreationdiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: What file type to store user account as?
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Store it as a `xml` file locally.
** Pros: The code to write and read xml file is already present for adding address book contact initially in the Address Book - level 4 app. Hence, adopting this code and modifying it for account storage is easier than coming up with code from scratch.
** Cons: Relatively wordy and verbose with all the opening and closing tag. For the same amount of account information, compared to other format such as `json`, more data has to be stored to account for tag elements.
* *Alternative 2:* Store it as a `json` file locally.
** Pros: Simpler syntax than `xml` and hence less data is required to store the same amount of account information.
** Pros: Can be parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
** Cons: Not familiar with json, hence more effort is needed to write code to store account in json format, compared to the already given code for xml storage.

==== Security Considerations

===== Database
Currently, the list of accounts is stored locally on data/accountlist.xml. For security purposes, we may consider the following implementations in the future for v2.0:

* **Encrypt accountlist.xml:** This can prevent direct lookup of the file as the content is encrypted
* **Store the file on a server:** Due to project restriction, we are unable to implement this at v1.4. Storing file on a server has an added advantage of utilising web security practises or employing third party services to help protect our account list in private servers.

===== Storing password
Username is stored in plaintext in accountlist.xml, as username is not private information. However, user password is hashed with `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` algorithm together with a `salt`, to prevent password from being visible in plaintext. `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` is deliberately chosen as it is a link:https://adambard.com/blog/3-wrong-ways-to-store-a-password/[slower] algorithm, thus slowing down brute-force attack for finding out user password. The hashing algorithm is present in `PasswordAuthentication` class and the implementation is based off this link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/2861125/3474[stackoverflow] answer.

=== Unique ID feature
*_Heart²_* assigns a unique ID to every `client` and `vendor` when they are added into *_Heart²_*.
This ID is unique within their contact type, meaning that a `client` and a `vendor` may have the same ID, but since this ID comes hand in hand with the contact type, they are effectively unique.
These IDs are last for a single session, and *_Heart²_* reassigns the IDs at the start of the next session.

==== Current Implementation
Both the `Client` and `Vendor` class have a `public static` running counter starting from 1.
When a `client` or `vendor` is created, it is assigned that number, before incrementing it by 1.
The `contact` then has this ID for this session, and the user can use this ID, coupled with the contact type to always refer to this particular contact.

This unique ID is used by many other commands, namely: `add`, `delete`, `update`, `view`, `addservice`, `automatch`.
It allows for these commands to be executed at any point in *_Heart²_*, with always the same context.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How should we refer to contacts in *_Heart²_*?

* *Alternative 1*:
Use the legacy implementation, which is to use the relative position of the contact in the list.

** Pros: No change is required, as it is the legacy implementation.

** Cons: Users have to navigate to a list that shows that contact, and the relative position of that contact may keep changing throughout a session.

* *Alternative 2* (current choice):

** Pros: Users are able to refer back to a particular contact at any time, without requiring the current list shown to contain that contact.
Also, this ID will never change during a session, so the user can confidently use the ID knowing that it will always refer to that contact.

** Cons: Users still have to remember this unique ID to refer back to the contact. It might be hard to remember the ID.

After much consideration, we decided to go with option 2.
*_Heart²_* is built for speed, and we would like to give our users flexibility to execute any command within *_Heart²_* at any time.
We believe that this can give users more control and power over their work using *_Heart²_*, and therefore we chose to implement this unique ID system.

However, we also do realise that users might find it hard to remember the unique ID assigned to the contact.
While users can quickly look at a recent contact using the command `history`, a possibly quality-of-life improvement would be to implement a mnemonic unique identifier.

=== Add contact feature
*_Heart²_* requires users to explicitly specify whether the contact to be added is a `client` or a `vendor` in the command.

* `client add n/Wai Lun p/90463327 e/wailun@u.nus.edu a/PGP House`
* `vendor add n/Lun Wai p/72336409 e/lunwai@u.nus.edu a/RVRC`

The above commands add a `client` and a `vendor`, together with the details provided, respectively.

This differentiation between `client` and `vendor` facilitates many other features of *_Heart²_*.
It complements the unique ID feature earlier to ensure that a `client` and a `vendor` with the same ID are still differentiable due to the contact type.

Adding of duplicate contacts are not allowed in *_Heart²_*.
[NOTE]
A contact is considered a duplicate if they are of the same contact type *and* have the same name *and* have *either* the same phone number *or* email address.

==== Current Implementation
Both `Client` and `Vendor` classes inherit from an abstract `Contact` class.
When adding a contact, either a new `Client` or a `Vendor` object is instantiated.
Both `Client` and `Vendor` objects are added to a list of generic type `Contact`.

In order to differentiate them, there is an abstract method `Contact#getType()` that `Client` and `Vendor` implement differently.
`Client` objects return a `ContactType.CLIENT` enum while `Vendor` objects return a `ContactType.VENDOR` enum.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How should we store `Client` and `Vendor` objects in *_Heart²_*?

* *Alternative 1* (current choice):
`Client` and `Vendor` objects are stored in a more general `Contact` list.
** Pros: Easy to implement by tweak the inherited legacy list slightly.

** Cons: Cannot tell immediately if an element in the `Contact` list is a `Client` or `Vendor`.
This might take a longer time to display lists, due to having to filter them every time.

* *Alternative 2*:
Hold `Client` and `Vendor` objects differently in two different lists.
** Pros: Able to get `Client` or `Vendor` immediately without having to go through the entire `Contact` list as in alternative 1.
** Cons: Difficult and extremely tedious to implement.

===== Aspect: How restrictive should the definition of a duplicate contact be?

* *Alternative 1*:
It should be regardless of contact type, meaning a `client` and a `vendor` cannot have the same name *and* either the same phone number *or* email.

** Pros: No additional implementation required. The legacy implementation already supports this.

** Cons: Less flexibility for our users. A `client` cannot be a `vendor` possibly.

* *Alternative 2* (current choice):
A `client` and a `vendor` can have similar fields, meaining a `client` and a `vendor` can possibly have the same name, phone number *and/or* email.

** Pros: More flexibility for our users. A `client` can be a `vendor` too, which is possible in the real world.

** Cons: Additional implementation to have.

=== Delete contact feature
*_Heart²_* allows the user to delete any contact, using the combination of its contact type and its unique ID, followed by `delete`.

* `client#2 delete`
* `vendor#3 delete`

The above commands delete the `client` given the unique ID #2 and the `vendor` given the unique ID #3.

This feature makes use of the fact that contacts are either `Client` or `Vendor` objects.
The unique ID is then used to identify the particular `Client` or `Vendor` object to be deleted.

==== Current Implementation
The current implementation filters the contact list by the specified contact type and ID.
The predicate to filter by `client` and `vendor` can be retrieved by `ContactType.CLIENT#getFilter()` and `ContactType.VENDOR#getFilter()` respectively.
This first predicate is then combined with another predicate that is looking for the ID of the `client` or `vendor`, specified in the command.

Since IDs are unique, after filtering by this (combined) predicate, the list can only have a maximum length of 1.
This would indicate that the contact in the list is the contact we are to delete.
However, if the list is of size 0, this means that the contact that is specified to be deleted does not exist.
We then can feedback to the user that the ID specified is invalid.

=== Update contact feature
*_Heart²_* allows the user to update any contact, using the combination of its contact type and its unique ID, followed by `update`.

* 'client#1 update n/Wai Lua'
* 'vendor#2 update p/9046 3328'

The above commands update the name of the `client` given the unique ID #2 to "Wai Lua", and the phone number of the `vendor` given the unique ID #2 to 9046 3328.

[NOTE]
A contact is considered a duplicate if they are of the same contact type *and* have the same name *and* have *either* the same phone number *or* email address.

As mentioned earlier, duplicate contacts are not allowed in *_Heart²_*.
Thus, when updating, the user is not allowed to update a contact in *_Heart²_* if updating it will result in duplicated contacts.

==== Implementation

The current implementation uses part of the legacy implementation to do the updating of contacts.
The arguments are parsed and tokenized using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String, Prefix...)`.
An `EditContactDescriptor` object is then created to hold this new information temporarily.

[TIP]
The prefixes applicable to `update` are `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/`. At least one of them must follow the `update` command.

Then, the current implementation filters the contact list by the specified contact type and ID.
The predicate to filter by `client` and `vendor` can be retrieved by `ContactType.CLIENT#getFilter()` and `ContactType.VENDOR#getFilter()` respectively.
This first predicate is then combined with another predicate that is looking for the ID of the `client` or `vendor`, specified in the command.

Since IDs are unique, after filtering by this (combined) predicate, the list can only have a maximum length of 1.
The contact in this list would be the contact to be updated.
A new contact is created using `UpdateCommand#createEditedContact(Contact, EditContactDescriptor, ContactType)`.
The next step is then to ensure that this new contact is not a duplicate contact, before replacing the old contact in *_Heart²_*.

[NOTE]
A contact is considered a duplicate if they are of the same contact type *and* have the same name *and* have *either* the same phone number *or* email address.

However, if the list is of size 0, this means that the contact that is specified to be deleted does not exist.
We then can feedback to the user that the ID specified is invalid.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Should a similar (have the same name *and* same phone number *or* email) `client` and `vendor` object be updated together?

* *Alternative 1* (current choice):
A `client` can be similar to a `vendor`, but they are still considered independent contacts in *_Heart²_*.

** Pros: No implementation required. The user has the choice to have their `client` and `vendor` be similar or not be.

** Cons: There are scenarios where the user would like to update the details of both the `client` and `vendor` together as they are similar.
In this case, they will have to update both manually.

* *Alternative 2*:
Updating a similar `client` or `vendor` should update its counterpart.

** Pros: The user can update a similar `client` and `vendor` together.

** Cons: Hard to implement. Also, the user will lack the flexibility of having his `client` and `vendor` be updated individually.

After much consideration, we decided to choose option 1, so that our user can have more flexibility in *_Heart²_*.
A lot of people have separate phone numbers and emails for personal use and work, and thus it made sense to us that these contacts should still be updated separately.

However, there will definitely be cases where users might want such similar contacts to be linked and updated together.
A possible quality-of-life improvement would be to allow an option (command) to link such similar contacts to each other, for updating.

=== View contact feature
*_Heart²_* allows the user to view any contact, using the combination of its contact type and its unique ID, followed by `view`.

* `client#3 view`
* `vendor#6 view`

The above commands selects the `client` with the unique ID #3 and the `vendor` with the unique ID #6 respectively for viewing.
The contact's card is shown on the panel on the right in *_Heart²_*, containing all the information regarding the contact.

[TIP]
By using `view`, all the information regarding the contact will be shown.
This includes the name, phone number, email address, tags, residential (`client`) or office address (`vendor`), and services requested (`client`) or services offered (`vendor`).

==== Implementation
The `view` command uses a similar implementation to the `add`, `delete` and `update` commands.
The current implementation filters the contact list by the specified contact type and ID.
The predicate to filter by `client` and `vendor` can be retrieved by `ContactType.CLIENT#getFilter()` and `ContactType.VENDOR#getFilter()` respectively.
This first predicate is then combined with another predicate that is looking for the ID of the `client` or `vendor`, specified in the command.

Since IDs are unique, after filtering by this (combined) predicate, the list can only have a maximum length of 1.
After obtaining this contact, a new `JumpToListRequestEvent` is posted to the event bus.
The `PersonListPanel` class is registered as an event handler, and it handles this `JumpToListRequestEvent` with `PersonListPanel#handleJumpToListRequestEvent(JumpToListRequestEvent)`.
The contact's card is then selected for viewing.

However, if the list is of size 0, this means that the contact that is specified for viewing does not exist.
We then can feedback to the user that the ID specified is invalid.

==== Design Considerations
The implementation of `view` was chosen to also use the combination of the contact type and ID to select a contact for viewing.
This is part of a standardisation effort to have cohesiveness in the command syntax.

=== Viewing Search Results [Coming in v2.0]
After the user entered the command into the `CommandBox`, the `BrowserPanel` would be deployed to list the search results in a tabular form:

image::Ui.png[width"800"]

==== Profile
The client's profile would be displayed on the left, so as to facilitate the user in picking the vendors while keeping the requirements in mind.

Data would be extracted from the client's `Contact` and the text would be set at their respective placeholders, with the
tags at the bottom left.

==== Tabular View
The results would be listed from the most to the least relevant based on the client's needs.
Users can then scroll through the list to view the other results in decreasing relevancy.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to display search results
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Present in a table
** Pros: Provides a bird's-eye view of all plausible vendors for the client so that the user can pick
the combination that best suits the client easily
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of extracting of data
* *Alternative 2:* Present in a list
** Pros: More efficient performance
** Cons: Users need to scroll through the list for each vendor individually

// tag::list[]
=== List Feature
*_Heart²_* allows you view all the clients or the vendors with a simple command: `list`.

When listing contacts, you would have to specify whether the contact is a client or a vendor
by prefixing it to list:

* `client list`
* `vendor list`

Below shows an example of how listing all clients works:

._The UI showing listing all clients._
image::ListAllClients.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

Furthermore, you are also able to add keywords after the list to do filtering, and each keyword is specified to
belong to a category and only contacts which contains all of the keywords in their respective categories will be shown.

[NOTE]
====
Categories include:

* `n/` NAME
* `p/` PHONE_NUMBER
* `e/` EMAIL_ADDRESS
* `a/` ADDRESS
* `t/` TAGS
====

Below shows an example of how list filtering works:

._The UI showing list filtering._
image::ListClientsWithKeywords.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

==== Implementation

The keywords from the command to be used for filtering is parsed by the `ListCommandParser` and passed to a `Predicate`
that is implemented as `ContactContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

We then use a `FilteredList` and pass the combination of 2 `Predicates` into it, one to filter the type of contact,
clients or vendors and the other is to filter by keywords.
// TODO: ADD UML DIAGRAM

==== Design considerations

[none]
==== Aspect 1: Substring Matching or Word Matching
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Substring matching.
** Pros: Users would be able to view a wider range of results that matches the substring they have given. Easier to use.
** Cons: Irrelevant results might not be filtered away if they contain the substring.
* *Alternative 2:* Word matching.
** Pros: Guarantees that no irrelevant results are shown.
** Cons: Relevant results that have a small difference in the wording will be filtered away and not shown.

[none]
==== Aspect 2: Categorised or Non-categorised keywords
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Categorised keywords.
** Pros: Users are able to specify which keywords they want to search for in which category.
Gives better control over the searching.
** Cons: Users have to follow a specific format to type the keywords.
* *Alternative 2:* Non-categorised keywords.
** Pros: User can type in the keywords in any order they want. Easier to use.
** Cons: Irrelevant results that contains the keywords will be shown.

[none]
==== Aspect 3: All Match or Any Match
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* All match.
** Pros: Users can specify what they want to search for and filter out all irrelevant results.
** Cons: Users are not able to search for multiple things, when they only require one of them to match.
* *Alternative 2:* Any match.
** Pros: Users are able to obtain a wider search result. Easier to use.
** Cons: Irrelevant results that contains only one or a few keywords will be shown as well.

// end::list[]

=== Finding matches between clients and vendors


The application boasts matchmaking features that reduces the (once-laborious) task of matching vendors a single command.

==== High level design

._High level overview of how auto-matching works_
image::auto-matching.png[width:"800"]

1. On invocation, the auto-matchmaking algorithm functionally maps all service requirements from a Client into predicates for performing the first step of filtering the Vendors.
2. The vendors are then sorted by a fair ranking algorithm to ensure even distribution of jobs between Vendors.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to fairly distribute jobs between vendors
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Pure random matching
** Pros: Fair at every selection round, easy implementation
** Cons: Even job distribution not guaranteed
* *Alternative 2:* Round robin
** Pros: Even job distribution guaranteed
** Cons: Requires keeping count of jobs allocated for each vendor
* *Alternative 3:* Review/ranking-based distribution
** Pros: Fair and rewards good performance
** Cons: Difficult to fine-tune ranking algorithm

== Documentation
image::documentationheader.png[width="400"]

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing
image::testingheader.png[width="320"]

Tests ensure that your code runs as expected. This section shows how you can run tests to test this application thoroughly.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops
image::devopsheader.png[width="320"]

DevOps is an approach to include automation and event monitoring at all steps of the software build. This section documents the tools and methods we used to ensure a high quality code production.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

image::appendixaheader.png[width="320"]

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing
image::appendixgheader.png[width="320"]

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.
For all commands except for `login`, `help`, and `exit`, user is expected to have already logged in to the application successfully and be at the main screen GUI page, not the login GUI page.

=== Launch the application

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the login page GUI. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Shutdown the application

. Exit the application with a command

.. Test case: `exit` +
   Expected: The GUI screen closes and the application exits.

. Exit the application by clicking on the GUI close button or force quitting the app (e.g. `alt` + `f4` on Windows, and `cmd` + `q` on Mac)

.. Expected: The GUI screen closes and the application exits.

=== Deleting a client

. Deleting a client while all clients are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all clients using the `client list` command. Multiple clients in the list.

   Expected: First client is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted client shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `client#0 delete` +
   Expected: No client is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `client3 delete`, `client#x delete` (where x is not a client's id), `delete client#1` +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Deleting a vendor

. Deleting a vendor while all vendors are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all vendors using the `vendor list` command. Multiple vendors in the list.
.. Test case: `vendor#1 delete` +
   Expected: First vendor is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted vendor shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `vendor#0 delete` +
   Expected: No vendor is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `vendor3 delete`, `vendor#x delete` (where x is not a vendor's id), `delete vendor#1` +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Logging in

. Log in to the application on new launch, or on log out.

.. Prerequisites: User must not already been logged in.
.. Test case: `login u/rootUser p/rootPassword` +
